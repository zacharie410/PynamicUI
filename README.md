# PynamicUI

PynamicUI is a lightweight Python library that provides a dynamic user interface (UI) framework for creating interactive and responsive applications. It simplifies the process of building user interfaces by abstracting away the complexities of working directly with a UI toolkit like Tkinter. With PynamicUI, you can create dynamic web-like UIs using a declarative syntax, making it easy to define and manage the UI components and their interactions.

## Features

- **Virtual DOM:** PynamicUI implements a Virtual DOM architecture, allowing you to define UI components using a declarative approach. The Virtual DOM efficiently manages updates and renders the UI components when necessary.

- **State Management:** PynamicUI includes a built-in state management system, allowing you to define and manage application states. State changes trigger automatic UI updates, ensuring your UI stays in sync with the underlying data.

- **Hooks and Effects:** PynamicUI provides hooks and effects to add custom logic and side effects to your UI components. You can utilize hooks to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or update. Effects enable you to respond to changes in state or other component properties.

- **Routing and Navigation:** PynamicUI supports routing and navigation, allowing you to create multi-page applications. You can define routes and associate them with specific UI components, enabling seamless navigation between different pages.
